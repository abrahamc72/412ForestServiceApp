This application has only been tested on Windows and required node.js to be installed.
After unzipping and installing node.js, StartApp.bat should be used to start it.  

How to use:  
	1.Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/  
	2.Make sure that npm is a runnable command (node js should added to path in installation)  
	3.When node.js is installed properly, StartApp.bat should open your browser and start a node.js server.  
	4.Its reccommended to allow the app to run through the firewall when the popup appears.  
	5.The app runs on port 8000. Make sure no other service is taking this port.  
	6.Hitting your browsers back/forward buttons may mess with the code. Only use navigation through the UI  
	7.Clicking the small link on top should reset the app, also visiting http://localhost:8000 should do the same.
